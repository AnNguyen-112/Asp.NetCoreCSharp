Assignment 01 Introduction to C# and Data Types
Understanding Data Types
Test your Knowledge

1. What type would you choose for the following “numbers”?
A person’s telephone number: string
A person’s height: double or float
A person’s age: int
A person’s gender (Male, Female, Prefer Not To Answer): string or enum
A person’s salary: decimal
A book’s ISBN: string
A book’s price: decimal
A book’s shipping weight: double or float
A country’s population: long
The number of stars in the universe: long (or BigInt)
The number of employees in each of the small or medium businesses in the
United Kingdom (up to about 50,000 employees per business): int

2. What are the difference between value type and reference type variables? What is
boxing and unboxing?
-	Value Types:  A value type holds the data directly, store in the stack.
-	Reference Types: A reference type holds a reference (or pointer) to the memory location where the data is stored, store in the heap.
-	Boxing: Boxing is the process of converting a value type to a reference type.
-	Unboxing: Unboxing is the process of converting a boxed reference type back into a value type.

3. What is meant by the terms managed resource and unmanaged resource in .NET
-	Managed Resources: Managed resources are resources that are handled and cleaned up automatically by the .NET.
-	Unmanaged Resources: Unmanaged resources are resources that are not handled by the .NET runtime or the Garbage Collector.

4. Whats the purpose of Garbage Collector in .NET?
-	Garbage Collector: The Garbage Collector (GC) is a key part of the .NET runtime and is responsible for automatically 
managing memory by reclaiming memory that is no longer in use.

Controlling Flow and Converting Types
Test your Knowledge
1. What happens when you divide an int variable by 0?
-	Dividing an int by 0 will throw a DivideByZeroException at runtime.

2. What happens when you divide a double variable by 0?
-	Dividing a double by 0 does not throw an exception. it will result Infinity/-Infinity or NaN.

3. What happens when you overflow an int variable, that is, set it to a value beyond its
range?
-	An OverFlowException is thrown.

4. What is the difference between x = y++; and x = ++y;?
x = y++: Pos-increment. The value of y is assigned to x first, and then y is increased.
x = ++y: Pre-increment. The value of y is increased, new value of y will be assigned to x.

5. What is the difference between break, continue, and return when used inside a loop
statement?
-	break: Exits the loop entirely.
-	continue: Skips the current iteration and moves to the next iteration.
-	return: Exits the method or function entirely, terminating the loop and the current method.


6. What are the three parts of a for statement and which of them are required?
-	Initialization (e.g., int i = 0)
-	Condition (e.g., i < 10)
-	Iteration (e.g., i++)
-	None of these parts are strictly required

7. What is the difference between the = and == operators?
-	=: Assignment operator, used to assign a value to a variable.
-	==: Equality operator, used to compare two values for equality.

8. Does the following statement compile? for ( ; true; ) ;
-	Yes, it compiles. This is an infinite loop with no body, and it will run forever unless terminated by a break or return statement.

9. What does the underscore _ represent in a switch expression?
-	The underscore _ acts as a default case, matching any value that hasn't been matched by other cases

10. What interface must an object implement to be enumerated over by using the foreach
statement?
-	An object must implement the IEnumerable or IEnumerable<T> interface to be used in a foreach loop
